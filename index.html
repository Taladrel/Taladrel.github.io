    Hi, my name is Ty Lynch and I'm a first-generation Australian My parents were both born in England and both mother and father moved over when they were young with their parents.<br/>
     They first met in Canberra where I was born when I was around 2 we moved to Bendigo, Victoria. I grew up and went to school in Bendigo until I turned 16 when I moved to Adelaide.<br/>
     I finished my schooling and started looking for work at that time I didn't think University was for me.<br/>
     I found an electrical apprenticeship through an apprentice agency which was great as it allowed me to get a varied range of experience.<br/>
     I completed my apprenticeship at the end of 2018 and have been working as a qualified electrician ever since.<br/>
     I currently have one pet, a bearded dragon named Spyro after the cult classic PlayStation game.

<br/>
My interests in IT Include building computers for personal use and friends and family, Keeping up on that latest technology advancements in personal computing and the way technology can improve lives and businesses. My interests in IT started when I was in primary school from my IT teacher it was my favorite class in school I spent a lot of time in the  IT lab and built a relationship with my teacher because of this got to do a lot of things at school that the average primary school student doesn't such as upgrading the computer system throughout the school by removing the old computers and setting up the new ones making sure that they where networked properly and ready for other students to use.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to come to RMIT because it's a young university and I didn't want to go to a university that was too worried about tradition to keep up with the ever-evolving world of IT. I also have a friend that recommended RMIT to me after attending the first year with RMIT and then moving to the University of South Australia. He explained that the course material is better and more relevant than at his current university.<br/>
<br/>
From my studies, I want to learn the ability to code in multiple languages such as javascript and C++ (Or one of the C alternatives) to industry standards. I also want to expand my knowledge in technology further than just everyday consumer products and learn what goes into the back end of a large corporation’s server and storage setups. Cybersecurity is also another interest that I want to study being able to protect data is something that I can relate to as I am quite a private person online.<br/>

<br/>
The position I’d be interested in applying for is working for a company called Wargmaing.net this studio created the popular online game World of Tanks. The position advertised is a Senior C++ Engineer to work their next generation of games using the Unreal Engine 4. Involving programming player input mechanics and AI Systems. The reason I’d be interested in this job is it involves something I’m passionate about gaming and something that I one day hope to be skilled at which is programming. Combining these both I feel like I would have a job that I would be extremely rewarded with and want to go to work each day.<br/>
<br/>
To apply for this position the skills the employers are looking for excellent knowledge in the language C++  and python would be takin in high regard. Previous experience with the Unreal 4 engine. Being able to work in a team environment and a passion to create a great game. Other skills that would help my application would be experienced in using agile development methods, a degree in computer science or similar. <br/>
<br/>
I do not currently hold any of the skills required for this role apart from being able to work well in a team environment. To gain the skills required for this role I would spend the next few years gaining my degree while also trying to gain experience in my free time using and working with Unreal engine 4 to gain knowledge and experience. After finishing my degree I would try to find a graduate job using the languages required in the game industry if I could not find an entry-level position in the game industry directly.<br/>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
From the 16 personalities test, I was identified as a Logistician (ISTJ-A) it is thought that is the most common personality type. The main characteristics of a Logistician are integrity, practical logic and dedication. Some of the strengths and weaknesses that can affect a Logistician working in a team are.<br/>
<br/>
Strengths<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Very Responsible</li>
<li>Calm and Practical</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Weaknesses<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Stubborn</li>
<li>Insensitive</li>
</ul>
<br>

<br>
From the learning style test I completed, I found out that I am a visual learner I learn by looking at pictures or reading and remember things by picturing them in my head. I’m usually neat and clean but if I become bored I’ll find something around the room to look at as I can get distracted easily.<br>
<br>

<br>
For my last test, I completed the big 5 personality test from the OCEAN results I was given
High in open meaning, I like to try and new things and like coming up with new ideas. High in Conscientiousness, I like to be organized and am a hard worker. Medium in Extroversion people who receive this score are called ambiverts I can change how extroverted I am depending on the situation but can become drained if I am in the wrong one. For Agreeableness, I was given a high but I don’t agree with is the result as I’m definitely not a yes man and am more then happy to say no if a situation calls for it or I disagree with something.  I received a medium score in Neuroticism, On a bad week I can get burned out if I take on to much and specific situations or people can make me upset or drained.<br>
<br>
<a href="#">https://www.scienceofpeople.com/personality-quiz-results/?score=386050647.14</a> <br>
<br>
I found the results of these tests quite interesting and think that the results from the 16 personalities test the most accurate of the 3 as I like to make decisions without letting emotion cloud my judgment and think that I am a responsible person. Being an electrician I think definitely affected my score in the learning style test as I think it has influenced me into working in different styles. For the last test, I think that while some categories are correct like Extroversion and open meaning I would disagree with the results I received in Agreeableness and Neuroticism.<br>
<br>

The way these results would influence my behavior in a team is while I can be calm and practicable I can be insensitive to other people's ideas if I disagree and this is something that my team and myself would need to be conscious of. Being a visual learner I find that in a group discussion I can become distracted and not pay attention and could missout on valuable information that could help. My workplace habits from the 16 personality test describe that I like to finish things on time and by the book and that's something that I would agree with.<br>
<br>
When forming a team I should take these results into account by taking a step back and making sure to let others formulate an opinion and take it in the same regard as my own try and be emotionally supportive and remove distractions from myself while working. Using diagrams and pictures where possible to help explain things to others will help explain the situation better and therefore helping the team. Working in a team with people with opposite personality traits to mine would also help create a well rounded and most likely functional team.<br>
<br>
<h3>Project Idea</h3>
The basic principle of my project idea is to form a phone application and website which works in unison with each other that is capable of connecting farmers with potential seasonal workers and overseas working visa holders that need to complete their hours for their second and third year working visas. This is in hopes of creating a safe and simple platform for workers and farmers to be able to work together with each other.<br>
<br>
The motivation for creating this service comes from meeting my current partner Charlotte. When we first met she was on a working visa and only planning to stay for one year.  When we looked at getting the hours she needed to gain her second-year visa we also started to realize how hard it was to find local work for her, not only that but it can also be quite dangerous as exploitation and abuse are not unheard of when it comes to backpackers.<br>
<br>
The features I would like to implement in the application are:<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>A profile system that for farms will include the name of the farm, the location, a simple job description, if tools or any previous experience are required and if accommodation is available on site. There will also be a feature that can recommend the nearest accommodation available to the workplace. For workers, the profile will include Their name,  previous workplaces if any and the location of they are looking for work in. Each profile type will be able to contact each other to say they are interested. </li><br>

<li> A rating system will also be implemented for all profiles so farmers and workers are able to rate each other so both parties are able to quickly tell and easily tell if something is wrong. This would be a star system quickly visible to the user on the front of the profile they are looking at. With further information about each review available after opening the profile. This feature will help workers tell if they are going to a safe environment and that others have been paid properly and will help farmers know if the person they are going to potentially employ is a responsible and hard worker.</li><br>
<li>Part of the working visa conditions are you must work a set number of days to be able to gain your next visa, the current being 3 months to gain your second year and then another 6 months to gain your third. You must be able to prove this and that’s where this feature would come in. A farmer would be able to add days to your profile once you’ve finished your term with them. This would make it easy to prove on your application from a simple and easily readable report.</li><br>
<li>Implemented in the application will be a payroll system this feature will not be mandatory to use but only there to make the lives of both parties easier a worker can input the hours or pieces they have done depending on the agreement and the farmer will be easily able to pay it into the workers designated bank account they have added to the service.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The software required would be a compiler that is capable of compiling a back end language possibly like PHP or python as well as java and swift for phone development, A software such as Atom to be able to write HTML for the website although a service like WordPress might also be applicable. Hardware requirements would either be the purchase or hire of servers to be able to host the information required and a variety of different phones to be able to test functionality with. <br>
<br>
The skills required to create this project would be either to learn or hire someone capable of coding the specific coding languages required. I think learning all the required languages required is possibly an unreasonable goal as it would take too long to learn each language but also the development time would be considerably longer. I also think that the server costs may also be an issue so a way to make money from the service may be needed which may make users unwilling to use it.<br>
<br>

The end outcome of this project would be to reduce the difficulty of finding seasonal work for people and making farmers' lives easier by reducing the time and money needed to spend looking for workers. While also increasing the safety of both parties involved. The impact this service could have could be quite large as it could scale easily to other industries for example construction when unskilled or limited skilled workers are required.<br>
