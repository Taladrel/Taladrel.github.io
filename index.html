<h3>Personal profile</h3>
Hi, my name is Ty Lynch and I'm a first-generation Australian. My parents were both born in England, both my mother and father moved over when they were young with their parents. My parents first met in Canberra, where I was born and when I was around 2 we moved to Bendigo, Victoria. I grew up and went to school in Bendigo until I turned 16 and then moved to Adelaide. I finished my schooling and started looking for work, at that time I didn't think university was for me. I found an electrical apprenticeship through an apprentice agency which was great as it allowed me to develop a wide range of new skillsets and experiences. I completed my apprenticeship at the end of 2018 and have been working as a qualified electrician ever since. I currently have a pet bearded dragon named Spyro after the cult classic PlayStation game.<br/>
<br>
<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
 My interests in IT include building computers for personal use, friends and family. Keeping up to date on the latest technology advancements in personal computing and the way technology can improve lives and businesses. My interest in IT started when I was in primary school from my IT teacher. IT was my favorite class in school which meant I spent a lot of time in the IT lab. I built a relationship with my teacher, which allowed me to do a lot of things at school that the average primary school student wouldn't. For example, upgrading the computer system throughout the school by removing the old computers and setting up the new ones, making sure that they were networked properly and ready for other students to use.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to come to RMIT because it's a young university; I didn't like the idea of going to a university that was too worried about their repuation and their traditions to keep up with the ever-evolving world of IT. I also have a friend that recommended me to RMIT, after spending a year there. He then went on to Uni SA, which he explained that the course material is better and more relevant at RMIT than at Uni SA, so I felt choosing RMIT was the uni for me.<br/>
<br/>
From my studies, I want to learn the ability to code in multiple languages such as javascript and C++ (Or one of the C alternatives) to industry standards. I also want to expand my knowledge in technology further than, just everyday consumer products and learn what goes into the back end of a large corporation’s server and storage setups. Cybersecurity is also another interest that I would like to study. Being able to protect data is something that I can relate to as I am quite a private person online.<br/>

<br/>
The position I’d be interested in applying for is working for a company called Wargmaing.net, this studio created the popular online game World of Tanks. The position advertised is a Senior C++ Engineer to work their next generation of games using the Unreal Engine 4, involving programming player input mechanics and AI Systems. The reason I’d be interested in this job is because it involves something I’m extremely passionate about. Gaming is something that I would like to one day be skilled at which in this particular job role is programming. Combining these both I feel like I would have a job that I would feel extremely privileged to be a part of and be excited to attend each day. <br/>
<br/>
To apply for this position the skills the employers are looking for are excellent knowledge in the language C++, python would be taken in high regard and previous experience with the Unreal 4 engine. The employees would also be after someone being able to work in a team environment and a passion to create a great game. Other skills that would help my application would be experienced in using agile development methods, a degree in computer science or similar.
 <br/>
<br/>
I do not currently hold any of the skills required for this role apart from being able to work well in a team environment. To gain the skills required for this role I would spend the next few years gaining my degree while also trying to gain experience in my free time using and working with Unreal engine 4 to gain knowledge and experience. After finishing my degree I would try to find a graduate job using the languages required in the game industry, if I could not find an entry-level position in the game industry directly.<br/>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
From the 16 Personalities Test, I was identified as a Logistician (ISTJ-A), it is thought that this is the most common personality type. The main characteristics of a Logistician are integrity, practical logic and dedication. Some of the strengths and weaknesses that can affect a Logistician working in a team are:<br/>
<br/>
Strengths<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Very Responsible</li>
<li>Calm and Practical</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Weaknesses<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Stubborn</li>
<li>Insensitive</li>
</ul>
<br>

From the learning style test I completed, I found out that I am a visual learner I learn by looking at pictures or reading and remember things by picturing them in my head. I’m usually neat and clean but if I become bored I’ll find something around the room to look at as I can get distracted easily.<br>

<br>
For my last test, I completed the Big 5 Personality Test. From the OCEAN results, I was given a “high” in open meaning; I like to try new things and like coming up with new ideas. I got given a “high” in conscientiousness; I like to be organized and I am a hard worker. I received a “medium” in extroversion, people who receive this score are called ambiverts. I can change how extroverted I am depending on the situation, but can become drained if I am in the wrong one. For agreeableness, I was given a “high”, but I don’t agree with the results as I’m definitely not a “yes man”. I am more than happy to say no if a situation calls for it or if I disagree with something. I received a “medium” score in neuroticism; on a bad week, I can get burned out if I take on too much on specific situations or when people make me upset or drained.<br>
<br>

<br>
I found the results of these tests quite interesting and I think that the results from the 16 Personalities Test were the most accurate of the three, as I like to make decisions without letting emotion cloud my judgment and I also believe that I am a responsible person. Being an electrician I believe has definitely affected my score in the Learning Style Test, as I think it has influenced me to work in different styles. For the last test, I think that while some categories are correct like extroversion and open meaning, I would disagree with the results I received in agreeableness and neuroticism because I don’t believe they fit within my personality..<br>
<br>

The way these results would influence my behavior in a team is that while I can be calm and practical, I can also be insensitive to other people's ideas and this is something that my team and myself would need to be conscious of. Being a visual learner I find that in a group discussion I can become distracted and not pay attention and could miss out on valuable information that could help me. My workplace habits from the 16 personality test describe that I like to finish things on time and by the book and that's something that I would highly agree with.<br>
<br>
When forming a team I should take these results into account by taking a step back and making sure to let others formulate an opinion. I should take it in the same regard as my own and to try to be emotionally supportive and remove distractions from myself while working. Using diagrams and pictures where possible to help explain things to others will help explain the situation better and therefore helping the team. Working in a team with people with opposite personality traits to mine would also help create a well rounded and most likely functional team.<br>
<br>
<h3>Project Idea</h3>
The basic principle of my project idea is to form a phone application and website, which works in unison with each other. The website and app will connect farmers with potential seasonal workers and overseas working holiday visa holders, that need to complete their hours for their second and third year working visas. This app and website is designed to create a safe and simple platform for workers and farmers to be able to work together.<br>
<br>
The motivation for creating this service comes from meeting my current partner Charlotte. When we first met she was on a working holiday visa and only planning to stay for one year. When we looked at getting the hours she needed to gain for her second-year visa, we also started to realize how hard it was to find local work for her. Not only that but it can also be quite dangerous as exploitation and abuse are not unheard of when it comes to backpackers.
<br>
<br>
The features I would like to implement in the application are:<br/>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>A profile system for farmers will include the name of the farm, location, a simple job description, if tools or any previous experience are required and if accommodation is available on site. There will also be a feature that can recommend the nearest accommodation available to the workplace. For workers, the profile will include their name, previous workplaces and the location of where they are looking for work. Each profile type will be able to contact each other, to show that they are interested.
 </li><br>

<li>  A rating system will be implemented for all profiles so farmers and workers are able to rate each other. This allows both parties to quickly tell and easily tell if something is wrong. This would be shown in a star system quickly visible to the user on the front of the profile they are looking at. With further information about each review available after opening the profile. This feature will help workers know that they are going to a safe environment and that others have been paid properly. It will also help farmers know if the person they are going to potentially employ is a responsible and hard worker.
</li><br>
<li> A rating system will be implemented for all profiles so farmers and workers are able to rate each other. This allows both parties to quickly tell and easily tell if something is wrong. This would be shown in a star system quickly visible to the user on the front of the profile they are looking at. With further information about each review available after opening the profile. This feature will help workers know that they are going to a safe environment and that others have been paid properly. It will also help farmers know if the person they are going to potentially employ is a responsible and hard worker.
</li><br>
<li>Implemented in the application will be a payroll system this feature will not be mandatory to use, but only there to make the lives of both parties easier. A worker can input the hours they have done depending on the agreement they have with the farmer. This makes it easier for the farmer to pay directly into the worker’s designated bank account.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
The software required would be a compiler that is capable of compiling a back end language possibly like PHP or python as well as java and swift for phone development. A software such as Atom to be able to write HTML for the website, although a service like WordPress might also be applicable. Hardware requirements would either be the purchase or hire of servers to be able to host the information required and a variety of different phones to be able to test functionality with.
 <br>
<br>
The skills required to create this project would be either to learn or hire someone capable of the specific coding languages required. I think learning all the required languages is possibly an unreasonable goal as it would take too long to learn each language, but also the development time would be considerably longer. I also think that the server costs may also be an issue, so a way to make money from the service may be needed which may make users unwilling to use it.<br>
<br>

The end outcome of this project would be to reduce the difficulty of finding seasonal work for working holiday visa holders and making farmers' lives easier by reducing the time and money needed to spend looking for workers. While also increasing the safety of both parties involved. The impact of this service could be quite large as it could scale easily to other industries for example construction when unskilled or limited skilled workers are required.
